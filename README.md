## ✨ About
👋 Hello, I’m Noufal Zidan Ivannov, an Informatics student at Universitas Jenderal Soedirman (2025).
I’m passionate about fullstack development — I started with Python and C++, and now I’m diving deeper into modern web technologies.

Outside the screen, I love training calisthenics 🏋️‍♂️ and playing guitar 🎸.
For me, balance matters: sharpening the mind through coding, strengthening the body through training, and fueling creativity through music.

Motto: Code. Train. Play. Repeat.
